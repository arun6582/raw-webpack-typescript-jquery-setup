## webpack + typescript + jquery initial config setup


run `yarn` to install node depencencies

run `yarn serve` to start development build

run `yarn build` to build production build

edit publicPath in the webpack.config.js to fit your static path
by default there is one entry in this config you can add more.



### tsconfig
 - you can start putting codes in src directory
 - you can import through absolute path rather than relative path. @src points to src folder
